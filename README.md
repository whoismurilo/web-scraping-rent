# Web Scraping for renting houses

The housing market is something that everyone living in any country has to deal with and, as a result, is a great topic about data analysis.

Within the next few days I will be moving to another city and I took the opportunity to use python to be able to research some houses and identify potential opportunities in that market.

I will use **Web Scraping** to extract data from the real estate market.

In this example, I used the data from the site https://casa.sapo.pt/ to be able to do the whole process. The chosen region was Odivelas and now with these data in hand, I will do an analysis and find better opportunities.

In the next few days I will create a new repository containing this information, I will create a regression model to be able to predict the rent value in this data.
