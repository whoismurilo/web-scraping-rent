# Web Scraping for renting houses

The housing market is something that everyone living in any country has to deal with and, as a result, is a great topic about data analysis.

Within the next few days I will be moving to another city and I took the opportunity to use python to be able to research some houses and identify potential opportunities in that market.

I will use **Web Scraping** to extract data from the real estate market.
